If you don't set up your IDE (like Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider) correctly for s&box development, you might run into issues like missing IntelliSense and missing references. Here's how to set it up properly.

## Visual Studio

1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed, at the time of writing, Visual Studio 2026 is required.
2. Install the `.NET desktop development` and `ASP.Net and web development` workload during installation, via the Visual Studio Installer, or go to `Tools -> Get Tools and Features` in Visual Studio.
3. Just to be sure, install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) as well. At the time of writing, s&box uses .NET 10. You may need to download both the SDK and the Runtime.

### Common Issues
- **Missing IntelliSense/References**: Open the solution file (`.slnx`) located in your project folder. You can do this from the `Project -> Open Solution` menu in the s&box editor.
- **slnx file opens as text**: Your Visual Studio installation is too old. Update to 2026 or later.

## JetBrains Rider

1. Make sure you have the latest version of [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/) installed.
2. Install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) as well. At the time of writing, s&box uses .NET 10. You may need to download both the SDK and the Runtime.
3. Open the solution file (`.slnx`) located in your project folder. You can do this from the `Project -> Open Solution` menu in the s&box editor.

## Visual Studio Code

Even if you follow the steps below, Visual Studio Code might still not work perfectly with s&box development. For the best experience, consider using Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.

1. Make sure you have the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.
2. Install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) as well. At the time of writing, s&box uses .NET 10. You may need to download both the SDK and the Runtime.
3. Install the `C#` and `C# Dev Kit` extensions from the extensions tab.
4. Open your s&box project folder in Visual Studio Code using `File -> Open Folder...`. Do not open the `code` folder, you want to open the root project folder.
5. If the solution file (`.slnx`) does not open automatically, open it manually from the dropdown in the bottom left corner of the window.

### Common Issues
- **Missing IntelliSense/References**: Make sure you have the `C#` and `C# Dev Kit` extensions installed. Make sure you have the latest .NET SDK installed. Open the solution properly as described above.
